* [React.js](https://react.dev) for the frontend.
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) with SQLite for the database management.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for the deployment and compatibility in other machines.

Other libraries used are:
* [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io) for the styling of the JSX code inside React components.
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to control some parts of the routing and navigation.

## How to run this project?
Once you have done the previous steps, now you can execute the project:

1. **Open a Command Prompt or Terminal:** Go to the project's folder (the one that you just downloaded) on your computer and open it. If you downloaded the ZIP file, first you have to unzip it, that is, right-click on the file and select "Extract here" on the WinRAR context menu. Inside the folder, right-click and in the context menu select "Open in Terminal".

2. **Run Docker command:** In the terminal, run the command `docker compose up`. This will mount the containers and images required for the project to work properly. Be patient, this can take some time.

3. **Use the app:** Once the installation and configuration of the project containers (from the last command) are complete, open a browser and write http://localhost:3000/. This will open the main page of the application.

4. **Main functionalities:**  This application allows you to register and login with employee accounts and manage the stored skills they have. Once you create an account (register), you can login with this account and manage your skills: creating, updating or deleting them. Also, these are displayed in a Spider type chart on your profile.

5. **Dummy user:** The program has a dummy account that you can use to login immediately after installation. Its credentials are:
    * **email:** `david@mail.com`
    * **password:** `mypassword`
